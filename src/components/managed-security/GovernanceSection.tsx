          Delegate the core components of managing your IT infrastructure to a
          dedicated expert, allowing leadership to focus on core operations
          rather than cybersecurity complexity. The governance module provides a
          stable foundation for companies operating in high-risk,
          data-sensitive, or critical service sectors. Receive a consistent
          overview of your security and compliance status via unified dashboard,
          and executive reporting.
